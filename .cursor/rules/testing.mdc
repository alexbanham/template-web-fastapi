# Testing & Verification

## Mandatory Verification

- **After creating or modifying any API endpoint**: Hit it (via browser, curl, or the test suite) and confirm the response is correct before considering the task done.
- **After changing frontend API calls**: Load the page in the browser and verify the data renders without errors. Check the browser console for warnings.
- **After installing a dependency**: Confirm the dev server still starts cleanly with no import or build errors.

## Run Verification Yourself

- **Do not only instruct the user**—run `curl`, start servers, and use the browser tools yourself when possible to verify behavior. Non-developers should not have to guess how to test.
- Backend: Run `curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/<endpoint>` in the terminal, or use Swagger at `/docs`.
- Frontend: Use the built-in browser to navigate to `http://localhost:5173`, take a snapshot, and confirm the UI and any API calls work.
- If servers need to be running, start them in the background, then run your verification. Report what you verified before closing the task.

## When to Write Tests

- Add a test when the logic has meaningful branching, edge cases, or is critical-path (auth, payments, data mutations).
- Simple CRUD or pass-through endpoints do not need unit tests immediately—verified manually is fine for a template.
- Test files go in `backend/tests/` mirroring the source structure.

## Do Not

- Do not mark a task complete if the server is throwing errors.
- Do not leave `console.log` or `print()` debugging statements in committed code.
- Do not skip verification because "it should work." Prove it works.
